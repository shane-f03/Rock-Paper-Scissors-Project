# Welcome to the Carleton AI Society Fall 2019 project!

We're going to be making an artificial intelligence that wins at Rock, Paper, Scissors!
It's been done before, but it's a good project to get your feet wet in AI.

[Example Algorithm Types](https://daniel.lawrence.lu/programming/rps/)

(You can find a large set of algorithms in Python that do pretty much what we're trying to do as a link on the above page, the small difference is that we will be playing real players instead of other algorithms and using Python 3 (not 2).)
